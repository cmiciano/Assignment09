//STEP 1


// Create an application that gets the number of days in a month. Display that result within the console window.

// Month in JavaScript is 0-indexed (January is 0, February is 1, etc), 
// but by using 0 as the day it will give us the last day of the prior
// month. So passing in 1 as the month number will return the last day
// of January, not February

// Create an application that gets the month name from a particular date. Display that result within the console window.

//STEP 4
// Create an application that gets yesterdayâ€™s day of the week. For instance, if today is Tuesday, the console window should display Monday.

//STEP 5
// Create an application that gets the current day of the week. The twist here is that I want only the first letter of the day. If today is Tuesday, the letter T should be displayed in the console window.
